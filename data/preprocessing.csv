objective health high dose vitamin c good people bad coronavirus,world continues freak covid advice authorities seems disproportionate panic stoking wash hands go unless avoid crowds seems like recipe making people panic msm continually poo pooed alternative therapies protecting treating coronavirus infections ignored actual evidence people experience rest world currently experiencing namely wuhan china specifically doctors front lines china worst epidemic singing praises vitamin c infusions today objective health take look one old favorites multiple conditions including coronavirus infections mighty vitamin c taking vitamin c actually something everyone could make difference state immune system well beyond wash hands elliot hello everyone welcome week edition objective health host elliot joining studio doug erica also damian ones twos today elliot today going talking hot topic going talking coronavirus couple weeks ago maybe couple months ago another show coronavirus assessing whether thought really dangerous whether little bit kicking frenzy going media little bit overblown today show going looking potential solution people think hopefully make use talk clinical utility using high dose vitamin c coronavirus quite lot interesting information come recently top well established information know vitamin c potential uses viruses coronavirus virus good reason think come virus immunocompromised little bit susceptible succumbing kind viral infection using vitamin c high doses various different methods consumption likely going helpful first want talk one recent progressions come china long ago china announced would thinking using intravenous vitamin c coronavirus patients three studies done china believe looking effect vitamin c coronavirus come pretty good results one chinese medical establishments scientists advocating use anywhere mg mg vitamin c used intravenously think severe patients viral infection doug interesting thing doses talking mg vitamin c iv even really high know things like cancer protocols get high g even higher sometimes low dose means could take mg orally fact getting good results doses says lot power vitamin c think erica definitely mainstream news least us pooh poohing alternative things think vitamin c going cure really concerning take something going keep immune system strong instead essentially dumping baby bathwater saying nothing going work people sort vitamin c medicine cabinet types things good keep immune system strong doug really surprising nonetheless shocking way media downplaying seen people reporting even mentioned china actually using vitamin c strategy coronavirus basically blanked like tulsi gabbard even mention fact despite fact many doctors china actually reporting talking explicitly saying helps news media turn around ignore fact even go far condemn right word like said erica pooh pooh essentially oh wait vaccine bother woo woo hippy crap meanwhile even people taking mg vitamin c times day would least helpful necessarily mean get going cure instantly anything help mitigate effects prevent stupid media taking kind stance elliot saw article earlier today abc news think one alphabet news agencies article titled coronavirus cures debunked talking vitamin c completely pooh poohing idea even like ignoring actively telling people take spineless things well established one top alternative integrated doctors quoted saying early sufficiently large doses intravenous vitamin c critical vitamin c prototypical antioxidant also involved virus killing prevention viral replication significance large dose intravenous vitamin c antiviral level acute respiratory distress syndrome kills people coronavirus ards acute respiratory distress syndrome common final pathway leading death talking vitamin c one best ways protect especially going apply people susceptible kinds infections think fair say people get probably going major issues mortality rate people pre existing severe health conditions immunocompromisation etc kinds people wise take right precautions listening media quick whip hysteria provide solutions doug seems like almost point literally nothing except wash hands laugher thing keep saying wash hands wash hands reading somewhere someone talking disproportionate crazy hysteria pumping thing actually offering something wash hands disproportionate level threat like threat solution wash hands anything people actually could like take vitamin c saying going work wash hands actually article green med info called tons vitamin c wuhan maybe pull one damian scroll bit tweet dsm wanted show show truck delivering tons vitamin c wuhan date one guess cut date see article march rd clearly delivering tons hell lot vitamin c using pretty disingenuous western media completely ignore fact outbreaks italy anywhere else start get really bad could benefit information doctors could benefit could actually helping people hospital fighting home could benefit information makes blood boil would pull kind shit terrible erica good article called vaccination viruses vitamin c potent antidote orthomolecular medicine news service january talk china list addendums regarding practical treatment approach coronavirus china things really stick strong immune system really significant protection individual keeping vitamin c going also said great deal immune system strength possibly comes vitamin c content immune cells levels vitamin c body low immune system never function full capacity many measures strengthen support immune system regular supplementation vitamin c multi gram doses mg daily probably single important preventative measure much larger doses given determined virus already contracted also talking nebulising hydrogen peroxide destroys sorts viruses body help vitamin c magnesium mop rest virus pretty helpful people freaking think anything something keep taking preventative measure anything doug professional doctors intravenous vitamin c probably stated even access intravenous vitamin c people actually still worthwhile taking orally well take much start feel digestive symptoms real side effects except diarrhoea take much would rather deal coronavirus little bit upset tummy mention website rthomolecular org article talking came actually really good site go orthomolecular org scroll says news releases number things specifically use vitamin c coronavirus talk used wuhan different chinese doctors reporting anybody interested information good resource erica something like liposomal know talked show making liposomal vitamin c survives digestive tract little bit better obviously intravenous get much liposomal encapsulated spheres survive digestive tract get body effectively doug basically increasing absorption nutrient take certain percentage get absorbed rest taking liposomal liposheric sometimes called increases amount getting across digestive tract bloodstream yeah effective elliot making really make effectively people claim make hold testing make proper liposomal need proper liposomal technology really want liposomal vitamin c better getting really high quality one paying money high quality vitamin c could probably get similar benefits taking small amount multiple times throughout day take high dose one given time absorb much one given time taking g every hour going continual absorption going opening transporters absorb makes sense lots options get intravenous liposomal oral going route take terms vitamin c actually many ways look vitamin c well known immune booster primarily one level promoting immune cells function certain immune cells responsible engulfing pathogens identifying clearing infections quickly become depleted ascorbic acid immune cells responsible surveillance lot ascorbic acid within job lose quickly taking ascorbic acid essentially topping immune cells immune cells really like ascorbic acid look specifically coronavirus interesting article written lady called doris loh done lot writing vitamin c various properties specifically relation vitamin c coronavirus looking mechanisms actually infects causes problems human body virus trying trick immune system evolved ways affect immune system goes undetected unable kill context tricks immune system trying surveil environment pick invaders takes lot energy virus disrupts immune system working affecting well cells able synthesise energy certain proteins called n proteins virus block mitochondria stop synthesising atp idea vitamin c working way cells synthesising energy form atp using things called electron carriers something called nadh fadh transported mitochondria donating electron going another various set processes make usable energy virus infects cell disrupts mitochondria functioning longer actually become depleted nadh nadh unable effectively donate electron ascorbic acid take place nadh act electron donor synthesise energy almost like ascorbic acid act energy source cells context immune dysfunction usually function ascorbic acid usually used antioxidant damage occurs cells called oxidation cells lose electrons function vitamin c donate electron called reduction essentially antioxidant used making energy whereas doris loh saying cases mitochondria screwed viral infection vitamin c longer becomes antioxidant actually donating electron us make energy well established fact might one reasons high doses actually necessary actually providing sustained form energy cells cells infected virus unable make means doug interesting elliot might one ways vitamin c actually beneficial aside roles one ways coronavirus messing immune system activating something called cytokine storm innate immune system inflammatory process ramps completely someone susceptible necessarily turn virus kills per se immune system inability shut immune system vitamin c potentially allowing us effectively shut immune system need lots different ways vitamin c might helping definitely antioxidant multiple different mechanisms absolutely fascinating would recommend listeners read called mitochondria coronavirus vitamin c connection people really need know vitamin c really useful downplay effects antioxidant doug also used pro oxidant well heard pro oxidant capabilities well something immune system uses eliminate viruses bacteria things like elliot exactly think one main mechanisms cancer know happening viruses familiar effect would make sense case take ascorbic acid low doses generally antioxidant giving ultra high doses actually generates hydrogen peroxide pro oxidant effect particularly cancer cells quite selective cancer cells know would work viruses think works infections similar way think lots stuff know erica going back saying cytokine storm stress also effect reaction everyone fear stress people feeling sure folks feeling europe also us stress adding cytokine storm inflammation body creating worse environment body ruminating stressing instead trying calm system elliot really unfortunate seems like causing lot harm inherently destructive sheer amount frenzy hysteria going seems relatively disproportionate actual threat coronavirus compare statistics infectious outbreaks seems relatively minor pretty much nothing burger opinion media makes worse boogeyman moment think people really scared understandably well informed well informed boost immune system kind stuff unfortunate ultimately really important know cortisol stress hormone also modulates immune system like saying erica multiple branches immune system stress hormones going suppressing branch immune system responsible surveilling infections viruses parasites type immune cells responsible ones talking natural killer cells lymphocytes different things go around body constant lookout viruses bacteria pathogens sensitive cortisol cortisol quickly downregulate system time upregulate system responsible attacking tissues autoimmune conditions massively rise people tend get sick frequently well allowing get overly stressed definitely worst possible thing could want protect infection like difficult watching media doug turn erica saying show us walk outside things seem normal turn computer end world coming via coronavirus unknowns elliot anything else anyone would like say doug one thing could say popular conception vitamin c high oranges orange juice marketing want get actual vitamin c supplement amounts find foods unfortunately negligible talking therapeutic doses eating oranges drinking orange really going cut wanted point want taking least gram time micrograms damian milligrams doug milligrams thank damian micrograms going cut either erica probably better cost effective buy ascorbic acid powder opposed chewable ones flintstones make laughter know mean flintstones

usually someone take grams makes get digestive symptoms infection go least times tolerate times usually could tolerated know couple people managed go grams poorly previously could tolerate g definitely get used way sick need much every day suffering infection find tends help erica proactive prevent stress mechanism taking keep making little detox cocktail vitamin c water enjoyable taste

simply add due various reasons reported independent citizen journalists empty hospitals inflated figures people falsely counted covid cases respiratory doctor also exposes covid test useless testing virus rather reaction virus since pcr test gold standard isolation purification etc koch postulates discussed merely testing rna sequences could caused many things dreaded new coronavirus strain pcr test limited function flawed used broad diagnosis uses cycles amplify rna sequence leads many people getting positive reality could cancer radiation many things also scathing things say fellow doctors going along program asking tough questions sad reflection profession since well known people look doctors give away power perceived authority good evening youtube future power people wanted let know respiratory therapist years kind place wanted show equipment room want talk covid minutes first thing want say look like ventilator shortage okay matter fact running less ventilators right would normally run cause people staying home elective surgeries want talk numbers criteria goes covid patient patient investigation also called pui basically right way last couple months locked us patient came respiratory problem labeled covid matter got stage lung cancer pancreatitis heart disease liver failure everything else still come breathing problems labeled covid patient one lady could testing first would go tests went cdc one person qualified test whole place several patients investigations never tested maybe died whatever would die covid stage lung cancer things clear come every single patient needs one pieces equipment need stuff okay rule covid tests taken long weeks get back finally getting claim claiming month finally getting house testing going change game think going places also means going see numbers either go go would suspect gon na see spike spike real quick reason number deaths recognize every single patient covid investigation dies goes covid death showing numbers like football game scare showing loading bodies tractor trailer scare never career ever seen bodies loaded tractor trailer happen wonder even bodies really believe stuff fake okay look ventilators let talk ventilators would shortage ventilators well non invasive ventilation cpap bipap mask gets strapped help breathe allowed use okay finally opening use little bit part since covid came said absolutely going cause virus spread place spraying air slaws everywhere use let patient crash go straight ventilator okay traditionally way would treat patient also air slides medications bronchodilators allowed use either everything would traditionally allowed every patient comes matter history labeled covid investigation patient dies becomes covid death okay ventilators killing people saving lot weird things going comes testing looking month also look open cbs news night testing virus like go get sick go hospital traditionally get tested flu b flu way h n one killed everybody test rsv actual viruses know test covid test different testing rna sequence reaction virus look please look testing virus one test test virus okay put pcr pcr test means amplifies little one little shred rna sequence damaged cell lungs nasal passage going test positive come cancer come radiation come several things hear talk news antibody therapy us kind stuff people want donate plasma everything else talking virus testing virus big big issue makes say well infectious telling us infectious telling us would use everybody would dying seeing okay unbelievable every bit created okay use non invasive ventilation go straight ventilator creates ventilator shortage also want ask ford gm business making ventilators plenty companies already make ventilator know kind ventilator going train us ventilators know going tested cost per ventilator united states paying gm products really obviously needed talk hear news governors everybody else shortages ventilators true true okay health care workers yeah getting one two healthcare workers coming positive know would expected would actually expect lot healthcare workers get sick come positive extreme contamination issues patients show symptoms patient investigation sudden came positive none health care workers came positive got sick carried fever anything else show real quick ppe wear sorry ppe wear n mask face shield course got gowns stuff going wearing shifts minimum get new one right contaminating every time put n masking shield bag contaminated contaminating putting mask okay still sick nobody else either except exception one two look areas people hot spots like georgia albany atlanta really say well places happening condensed areas well truly believe something else causing patients comorbidities older ones know life threatening situations mortality rate really low actually look going compared h n h n million times scary covid hen comes vaccination vaccinate really sinus infection going work vaccinate every little

bill gates need know covid vaccine,continue socially distance bid reduce effect covid important understand terms vaccine predictions show could take anywhere months years create vaccine small matter producing upwards billion doses global population bill gates looks already done create vaccine coronavirus one questions get asked days world able go back way things december coronavirus pandemic answer always almost perfect drug treat covid almost every person planet vaccinated coronavirus former unlikely happen anytime soon need miracle treatment least percent effective stop outbreak drug candidates right nowhere near powerful could save lot lives enough get us back normal leaves us vaccine read leading covid vaccine scientist answers questions launches global initiative create equitable access covid drugs vaccines humankind never urgent task creating broad immunity coronavirus realistically going return normal need develop safe effective vaccine need make billions doses need get every part world need happen quickly possible sounds daunting foundation biggest funder vaccines world effort dwarfs anything ever worked going require global cooperative effort like world never seen know get done simply alternative need know race create covid vaccine world creating vaccine historically fast timeline dr anthony fauci said thinks take around eighteen months develop coronavirus vaccine agree though could little months long two years although eighteen months might sound like long time would fastest scientists created new vaccine development usually takes around five years pick disease target create vaccine test animals begin testing safety efficacy humans safety efficacy two important goals every vaccine safety exactly sounds like vaccine safe give people minor side effects like mild fever injection site pain acceptable want inoculate people something makes sick efficacy measures well vaccine protects getting sick although ideally want vaccine percent efficacy many example year flu vaccine around percent effective test safety efficacy every vaccine goes three phases trials phase one safety trial small group healthy volunteers gets vaccine candidate try different dosages create strongest immune response lowest effective dose without serious side effects settled formula move onto phase two tells well vaccine works people intended get time hundreds people get vaccine cohort include people different ages health statuses phase three give thousands people usually longest phase occurs called natural disease conditions introduce large group people likely already risk infection target pathogen wait see vaccine reduces many people get sick vaccine passes three trial phases start building factories manufacture gets submitted various government agencies approval process works well vaccines normal development timeline good enough right every day cut process make huge difference world terms saving lives reducing trillions dollars economic damage speed process vaccine developers compressing timeline graphic shows traditional process steps sequential address key questions unknowns help mitigate financial risk since creating new vaccine expensive many candidates fail companies wait invest next step know previous step successful covid financing development issue governments organizations including foundation amazing alliance called coalition epidemic preparedness innovations made clear support whatever takes find vaccine scientists able save time several development steps example private sector governments foundation going start identifying facilities manufacture different potential vaccines facilities end going unused okay small price pay getting ahead production fortunately compressing trial timeline way take process usually takes five years get done months another way going testing lots different approaches time dozens candidates pipeline april different covid vaccine candidates development pipeline think eight ten look particularly promising foundation going keep eye others see missed positive characteristics though promising candidates take variety approaches protecting body covid understand exactly means helpful remember human immune system works disease pathogen gets system immune system responds producing antibodies antibodies attach substances called antigens surface microbe sends signal body attack immune system keeps record every microbe ever defeated quickly recognize destroy invaders make ill vaccines circumvent whole process teaching body defeat pathogen without ever getting sick two common types ones probably familiar inactivated live vaccines inactivated vaccines contain pathogens killed live vaccines hand made living pathogens weakened attenuated highly effective prone side effects inactivated counterparts inactivated live vaccines consider traditional approaches number covid vaccine candidates types good reason well established know test manufacture downside time consuming make ton material dose vaccine material biological means grow takes time unfortunately particularly excited two new approaches candidates taking rna dna vaccines one new approaches pans likely able get vaccines whole world much faster sake simplicity going explain rna vaccines dna vaccines similar different type genetic material method administration foundation funding cepi supporting development rna vaccine platform nearly decade planning use make vaccines diseases affect poor like malaria looking like one promising options covid first candidate start human trials rna vaccine created company called moderna rna vaccine works rather injecting pathogen antigen body instead give body genetic code needed produce antigen antigens appear outside cells immune system attacks learns defeat future intruders process essentially turn body vaccine manufacturing unit rna vaccines let body work require much material makes much faster manufacture catch though know sure yet rna viable platform vaccines since covid would first rna vaccine gate prove platform works creates immunity bit like building computer system first piece software time even rna vaccine continues show promise still must continue pursuing options know yet covid vaccine look like go full steam ahead many approaches possible might perfect vaccine yet okay smallpox vaccine vaccine wiped entire disease face earth also pretty brutal receive left scar arm anyone got one every three people side effects bad enough keep home school work small insignificant number developed serious reactions smallpox vaccine far perfect got job done covid vaccine might similar designing perfect vaccine want completely safe percent effective single dose gives lifelong protection easy store transport hope covid vaccine qualities given timeline may two priorities mentioned earlier safety efficacy since might time multi year studies conduct robust phase safety trials make sure good real world evidence vaccine completely safe use bit wiggle room efficacy suspect vaccine least percent effective enough stop outbreak percent effective vaccine useable might still see localized outbreaks anything percent unlikely create enough herd immunity stop virus big challenge making sure vaccine works well older people older less effective vaccines immune system like rest body ages slower recognize attack invaders big issue covid vaccine since older people vulnerable need make sure protected shingles vaccine also targeted older people combats amping strength vaccine possible something similar covid although might come side effects health authorities could also ask people certain age get additional dose beyond safety efficacy couple factors consider many doses vaccine get easier quicker deliver may need multi dose vaccine get enough efficacy long last ideally vaccine give long lasting protection might end one stops getting sick couple months like seasonal flu vaccine protects six months happens short term vaccine might used work durable one store many common vaccines kept degrees c around temperature average refrigerator storage transportation easy rna vaccines need stored much colder temperature low degrees c make reaching certain parts world difficult hope vaccine months close perfect possible even continue working improve happens suspect covid vaccine become part routine newborn immunization schedule vaccine though still huge problems solve need manufacture distribute least billion doses vaccine order stop pandemic need make vaccine available almost every person planet never delivered something every corner world mentioned earlier vaccines particularly difficult make store lot figure manufacturing distributing vaccine know exactly working example able use existing vaccine factories make covid vaccine build different kinds vaccine factories prepare vaccine type requires different kind factory need ready facilities make type start manufacturing final vaccine vaccines soon cost billions dollars governments need quickly find mechanism making funding available foundation currently working cepi governments figure financing part discussions center get vaccine reality everyone able get vaccine time take months even years create billion doses possibly billion multi dose vaccine start distributing soon first batch ready go people agree health workers get vaccine first gets next older people teachers workers essential jobs think low income countries first receive people much higher risk dying places covid spread much quicker poor countries measures like physical distancing harder enact people poor underlying health makes vulnerable complications weak health systems make harder receive care need getting vaccine low income countries could save

twitter cdc national influenza surveillance report regularly tracks symptoms similar covid noted symptoms fever coughs sore throats trending confirmed flu cases going common symptoms flu covid similar coronavirus spreads become nationwide crisis beginning severely strain health care system older adults chronically ill particularly susceptible severe covid illness tens hundreds thousands could require hospitalization coming weeks months need take collective measures protect others need know get covid lot acronyms floating around first know sars cov virus coronavirus causes disease covid virus commonly spread close contact infected people within feet cough sneeze send droplets air land mouths noses people nearby possibly get inhaled lungs droplets containing virus also land surfaces objects virus survive time according preprint paper study yet peer reviewed researchers national institutes health princeton ucla studied novel coronavirus lab survive hours cardboard two three days plastic stainless steel another study suggests stay infectious nine days danger infection touching one surfaces touching eyes nose mouth cdc however says thought main way virus spreads diseases like measles also transmitted aerosols meaning someone coughs tiny droplets filled virus linger air sometimes hours others breathe currently limited evidence coronavirus transmitted way worth noting one preprint found virus aerosol form hospitals wuhan others agree higher risk doctors nurses infected aerosols also growing evidence fecal oral transmission meaning ingest virus shed feces inadequate hand washing contaminated food water good news transmission prevented good personal hygiene social distancing effective one people normally goes crazy hand washing says megan murray infectious disease

infectious early disease even symptoms start meaning soon start feel ill important self isolate need coughing contagious linked preprint suggests somewhere percent people singapore cluster infected someone without symptoms makes taking precautions like canceling travel plans social gatherings even important effectiveness widespread travel bans especially community transmission already occurring hotly debated general minimizing social contact best method prevention avoid handshakes hugs people whenever possible stay least feet away others includes minimizing avoiding play dates sleepovers shared meals going eat visits friends family members homes also important know according one study china around percent cases may originate people symptoms another reason social distancing measures

outbreak covid holy name medical center confirmed covid cases march six icu ages ranging fever dry cough one symptoms new coronavirus call doctor older underlying medical conditions even important

best thing next self isolate including staying away anyone live one cdc high risk categories trying see doctor may actually expose single place likely encounter people coronavirus hospital last place want afraid getting infected murray says quest get tested go multiple health care centers exposing health care workers location think might covid frankly even avoid possibly spreading symptoms avoid public areas means go school work try avoid taking public transportation including ride hailing services like uber lyfts taxis adequate supplies home consider asking friends family make delivery door rather going let friends come visit recuperating instead stay connected phone online best way take care home self care coronavirus similar upper respiratory infections says elisa choi infectious disease internal medicine specialist boston area counter medications like cough suppressants help minimize coughing episodes expectorants help cough stuff pain relievers fever reducers like acetaminophen brand name tylenol help treat muscle aches reduce fevers abundance caution march began recommending people covid symptoms avoid taking ibuprofen reversed course scientists say much data back multiple assumptions made hypothesis made without tested angela rasmussen research scientist columbia university center infection immunity told vox knowledge evidence ibuprofen makes covid worse choi also urges using common sense manage symptoms feeling congestion try taking hot shower steam says sleep water always good advice cdc says drinking enough water every day generally good overall health choi medical professionals warn circulating misinformation supposed home remedies happening email erroneously claiming stanford remedies include holding breath without coughing keeping mouth moist many ideas unproven dangerous example overdose zinc really time stick facts choi says stay away things promoted sale without known background recommends always checking doctor questions veracity particular source cdc well local state public health departments good sources updated verified information sick protect people live choi says suspected confirmed covid patients stay room ideally share bathroom try stay far away possible anyone else household least feet added share bathroom avoid room time anyone else found transmission china family members sick person feels ideally one disinfect bathroom use living situation allow isolate others home tell doctor health department cdc complete guide disinfecting commonly touched surfaces like counters tabletops doorknobs bathroom fixtures toilets phones keyboards tablets bedside tables recommends every day use one approved products make like adding four teaspoons bleach quart water cdc also recommends wearing gloves touching possibly infected items like used clothing bedding well disinfecting commonly used surfaces finished throw gloves directly garbage wash hands choi suggests washing hands frequently protect others household covering nose mouth cough sneeze tissue throw directly garbage feeling ill share cups utensils dish bath towels toothpaste bedding anything else anyone coronavirus stick around surfaces several days seek additional medical care choi recommends closely monitoring symptoms less number progression says generally low grade fever considered less older people generally less likely mount fever response main thing watch symptoms getting worse example initially mild cough start prolonged bouts coughing becomes painful recommends calling doctor cdc says seek medical attention immediately difficulty breathing shortness breath persistent pain chest pressure onset confusion inability stay awake bluish lips face decide go hospital make sure call ahead hospital prepare admit without exposing others already mask home would good time wear cdc recommended cloth masks everyone infants certain public settings medical masks reserved health workers sick people severe shortage know go hospital currently treatment covid remdesivir antiviral drug clinical trials right doctors limited providing supportive care supplemental oxygen long stay isolated still lot know murray says self isolate least days initial symptoms reports patients shedding viruses days appear outliers means avoiding contact everyone read vox guide self isolation part choi recommends minimizing contact doctor public health department tells longer contagious already cabin fever kids bouncing walls anxious sleep help measures pandemic control stressful choi says especially people may challenges isolated feeling may get worse next weeks current social distancing measures likely extended measures also cause financial hardship stress people work home get paid go work many people experiencing cognitive dissonance ongoing normality daily lives conversely experiencing rapid change kind others struggling whether afraid getting sick reacting uncertainty financial hardship lack information anxiety natural response alone preexisting mental health conditions aware may trigger new worsening symptoms substance abuse mental health service administration disaster distress helpline reachable also app additional resources matter stressed feel crucial scapegoat others virus transmitted infecting particular group experienced anti asian racism says choi disrespectful hateful grounded facts know situation hopeless collectively changing behavior go long way toward controlling spread disease china closed temporary hospitals case numbers continue decline social economic repercussions pandemic may continue

preprint showed monkeys reinfection covid occur hotez suggests recovered patients seem produce antibodies pointed new paper possibility using blood recovered patients treatment even preventive measure first responders still recovered patients may also experience lasting effects doctors hong kong said recovered patients percent drop lung capacity another alarming preprint suggests patients may permanent kidney damage building herd immunity uk government early announced strategy allowing virus spread build herd immunity although since walked back recommending self isolation herd immunity control covid percent population need get disease logic extreme lockdowns stop virus returning future measures loosened problem many people may succumb disease meantime attempting control spread hospitals medical systems overwhelmed achieving herd immunity uk would require million britons infected could mean around hundreds thousands would die immunity might also last long enough help flu new strains emerge year relying herd immunity also conflicts policy anthony costello pediatrician former director tweeted ethical adopt policy threatens immediate casualties basis uncertain future benefit two likely ways pandemic end virus widespread many people get develop natural herd immunity term used describe people getting disease becoming immune result make widely produce affordable vaccine unlikely see big decline covid cases solely due weather getting warmer plenty places currently warm weather like singapore australia covid cases easy answers recognize gon na start seeing fair number hospital admissions especially icu admissions hotez says ask hard questions treatment developing vaccine take many months best meantime changing behavior important ultimately new disease trying make
